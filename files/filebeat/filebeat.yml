###################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The filebeat.reference.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

# For more available modules and options, please see the filebeat.reference.yml sample
# configuration file.

# ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================

filebeat.inputs:

  # Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
  # you can use different inputs for various configurations.
  # Below are the input specific configurations.

  - type: log

    # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
    enabled: true

    # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
    paths:
      - /site/logs/supervisor/*.log
      - /site/logs/php/*.log
      - /site/logs/cron.log
      - /site/logs/initialise.log
      #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

    # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
    # matching any regular expression from the list.
    #exclude_lines: ['^DBG']

    # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
    # matching any regular expression from the list.
    #include_lines: ['^ERR', '^WARN']

    # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
    # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
    #exclude_files: ['.gz$']

    # Optional additional fields. These fields can be freely picked
    # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
    #fields:
    #  level: debug
    #  review: 1

    ### Multiline options

    # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
    # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

    # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
    #multiline.pattern: ^\[

    # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
    #multiline.negate: false

    # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
    # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
    # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
    #multiline.match: after

  # ============================== Filebeat modules ==============================

# ======================= Elasticsearch template setting =======================

setup.template.settings:

# ================================== General ===================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
name: "ELK_FILEBEAT_SHIPPER_NAME"

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
fields:
  env: "ELK_ENVIROMENT"

# ================================= Dashboards =================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false
setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

# =================================== Kibana ===================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:

  host: "ELK_KIBANA_HOST"
  protocol: "ELK_KIBANA_PROTOCOL"

# ================================== Logging ===================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug
logging:
  level: warning

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Filebeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false
monitoring.enabled: true

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Filebeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

# ================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: true
